# Unfortunate announcement:
I am sorry to announce that by 6 july 2023 I decided to totally dispose the project, it's been a cool journey I learned alot, but I realised that gaming is a waste of time, it's not bad if you only do it in your free time, other than that windows is **NOT** an open source operatin system therefore it doesn't have alot of options for modifying or tweaking it, so I would rather try to modify linux or android as they are really fun to tinker with. I might be active in android community sometime soon, anything I do, I will upload it to github.
thanks for reading!
